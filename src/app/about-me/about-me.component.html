      Hobbies
    </h2>
    <p>
      In my spare time I spend a lot of time teaching myself how to do things on the frontend. Ever since my final year
      of university I've had a strong interest in Angular. Over the years I've found I definitely favour heavily
      opinionated
      languages and frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also spend a lot of time listening to music and discovering new music to listen to. I'm really into physical
      media
      so I'm always looking for vinyl records of music I like, as well as physical copies of video games to add to my
      collection.

      Want to hire me?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you like what you've read about me and wish to get in contact about a job, here are some of my preferences and
      what I would be looking for in my next role. I don't require any all of these but the more boxes that are ticked, the better.
      Just like if I was applying for a job I would need to reference aspects of the job posting, I ask that if you initiate
      contact, that you do so with references to as many of these points as possible.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc text-left">
      <li>
        Intermediate Level - I have a lot of recruiters contacting me about junior or senior positions and then act
        surprised when I tell them I'm over / under qualified. If you have a position like this, but the experience level
        can be flexible to include intermediate, then be sure to mention that.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salary - Be up front with what I can expect given my current experience level. I will not disclose my current salary
        if asked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Location - I currently HEAVILY favour remote work but I am willing to work in person depending on other factors,
        such as salary and location. I am open to relocating, including to Australia, for the right role.
      </li>
      <li>
        Product Age - The younger the product the better. I love learning about new and modern technologies, as well as
        the whole process of planning a project as early as possible. Being able to get in at the ground floor and have
        some influence on decisions would be great.
      </li>
      <li>
        Industry - Working in an industry that appeals to me and that I'm passionate about is really important to me. I
        know this is very broad and hard to quantify, but the best way to put it is that I have no interest in industries
        such as banking or accounting for example. Somewhere that can have a positive impact on society or related to a
        personal hobby would be ideal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Co workers - Throughout my entire career I have always been the least experienced person at every job. I remember
        how much I struggled when I first started my career so I would love to be on a team where I can mentor or have
        the opportunity to help some more junior devs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Career Progression - What are the promotional paths from the initial role? Where can I expect to be in 1, 2, 5 years?
        I have a natural desire to gravitate towards leadership positions and would jump at any opportunity where that would
        be a possibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        AWS - Ideally I would like to avoid anywhere that uses AWS for anything. The way Amazon employees are treated is
        criminal and I strongly support using any alternatives to their products. 
      </li>
    </ul>
